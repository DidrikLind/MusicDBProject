# MusicDBProject<br>
<h1>AUTHORS: Didrik Lind & Thai Pham</h1>
<h1>Short project description</h1>
<p>Java, JDBC and MySQL is the main point of this project.<br>
We have used MVC and DAO design pattern in order to implement a visualization(gui) of a music database with 4 tables: Album, Artist, Track and Genre.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
*pair-programming [ok] <br>
*use git/GitHub [ok] <br>

<h2>Application Requirements**</h2>
*Design database and implement in MySQL [ok] <br>
*Draw ER-diagram [ok] <br>
*Atleast three tabels [ok] <br>
*fulfill normalforms [ok] <br>
*atleast two foreign keys [ok] <br>
<-:(GUI):-> <br>
*fulfill CRUD [ok] <br>
*have some sort of selection functionality [ok] <br>
*have some sort of search functionality [ok]

<h2>Enhancements that can be made</h2>
*Simplify columns in the GUI, take away confusing "id's" for the user (Though this application is just a visualization of the database, so it depends of the usage in the future)<br>
*Develop the search function so it includes several of colummns in one search etc.<br>
*Maybe use Composite pattern(modified a bit maybe) to reduce the amount of "repeated" code, though the DAO-pattern can be vvery nicely used with Hibernate in the future if one would like to manipulate the code for Hibernate usage.
